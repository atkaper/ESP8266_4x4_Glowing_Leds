# 4x4 bottle light red/orange matrix led glow

Note: this is a quickly hacked togehter piece of code. Might change in future, as it's not ready yet.
See blog post: https://www.kaper.com/electronics/glowing-bottle/

Known Issue:
- write of config changes crashes the ESP, need to use one big file, or switch to new file-system.

Change plans:
- Add option to change all colors in use, and test them one by one.
- Add option to turn on/off the light.
- Perhaps add voice control? (e.g. "alexa - turn off bottle lamp").
- Perhaps add timed on/off schedule? (on during day, off during night).
